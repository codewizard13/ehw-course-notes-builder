### Description:

JavaScript is a scripting language of the web. As the web evolves from a static to a dynamic environment, technology focus is shifting from static markup and styling—frequently handled by content management systems or automated scripts—to dynamic interfaces and advanced interaction. Once seen as optional, JavaScript is now becoming an integral part of the web, infusing every layer with its script.<br><br>Through practical examples and mini-projects, this course helps you build your understanding of JavaScript piece by piece, from core principles like variables, data types, conditionals, and functions through advanced topics including loops, and DOM scripting. Along the way, instructor Morten Rand-Hendriksen provides challenges that allow you to put your new skills to the test.

### 0. Introduction  

 #### 0.0 JavaScript: The soil from which the modern web grows

- The modern web runs on JavaScript
- Foundational elements of JS
- JAMstack
- HTML is language of web content, CSS is language of web style, JS is language the binds it all together
- This course deep understanding of modern JS
- JS primary lang for everything we do on web

 #### 0.1 How to use the exercise files

- Ex files avail from GitHub
- Folder with e suffix represent the end state
- PDF attached
- Link to doc or code refs in many exercise files

### 1. JavaScript: A Brief Introduction  
 #### 1.0 JavaScript: First contact

- A new era of web dev
- JS on browser, server, localhost
  
<!-- H5 will represent slides in many cases-->
##### Apply practical skils

- Modern JS & tooling
- JSX & Typescript
- Frameworks
- We are going to start with complex and then break it down

- Typical react component is long and complex

##### JSX

- A syntax extension of JS created for the React JS framework


- If I'm going to learn React should I just learn JSX?
- NO! JSX is an extension, so you still need basics
- If you undestand the basics you will be able to quickly pickup JSX and other JS flavors

##### Components

- Objects
- Methods
- Functions
- Template Literals
- Arrays

- At end of course we will return to this component and you will be able to make sense of it

 #### 1.1 Navigating the JS landscape

- Overwhelmed by that all the JS flavors
- Vanilla Javascript
- ES2015
- Babel
- React
- Vue.js
- ECMAScript
- CoffeScript
- JSX
- TypeScript
- Angular
- ES6
- WebPack
- Node.js
- Gulp

- JS is constantly evolving

##### Morten's Incomplete Guide to Navigating the JS Landscape:

- Javascript: the core lang; sometimes referred to as vanilla JS
- This is what we will cover in this course

- ECMAScript: browser specification of the JS lang. not the lang itself, but official description of how the lang should be interpreted by browsers
- Cutting edge
  
- Babel.js: Use to convert modern JS into plain JS the browser can read

- JS is an opinionated coding lang

- TypeScript: variation, dialect, or flavor of JS introducing features like **strong typing**
- Abstracted versions of JS with additional features.
- .ts ext
- CoffeeScript: another dialect of JS


- React, Vue, Angular: JS frameworks allowing us to write JS-based font-end apps. Adds abstraction layer on top of JS
- Introduce new coding convention like JSX and reliance on tools like Beble, WebPack, and Node.js
- 

- npm, WebPack, Gulp: Build tools and infrastructure to automate the process of optimizing human-readable JavaScript for the best browser performance

- Node.js: JS server runtime used to run JS everywhere; used to run npm, WebPack, Babel, and more on your computer

TAKEAWAY:
- Learn JS first then optimize and specialize your knowledge

 #### 1.2 Tools for working with JavaScript

- Modern browser: ideally all the browsers for testing (Chrome, Firefox)
- Code editor: VS Code is becoming industry standard. Highlight code as you work
- Live server env: extension for VS Code or similar. Efficieny
- Browser console: included with every browser

- Live Server (Ritwick Dey)

 #### 1.3 Linting and formatting

- Morten is dyslexic
- Code highlighter helps, but other extensions help
- ESLint: helps auto detect coding errors and can do basic cleanup auto
- Prettier: helps auto clean up your formatting
- Both require Node.js (install Node.js via download)

##### Install NPM

- Navigate to Terminal install
- `npm install`: node package manager goes on the internet and pulls everything into VS code to get prettier and eslint to work
- With prettier you can set what rules to enforce


 #### 1.4 Get to know the browser console

- JS doesn't run in the code editor it runs in the browser

EX: 01_05

Script.js
- Click Go Live at bottom bar of VSCode
- Go to current folder 01_05
- Open console
- `window.document`

- `backpack` hit right key for autocomplete
- `backpack.toggleLid(true)`
- `backpack`: lid is still set to true

 #### 1.5 JavaScript language basics

EX: 01_06

- Write JS top to bottom
- Define functions top before you use them
- Code comments: green
- **JS Doc:** Verbose comment: `/**` [ENTER]:

```
/**
 * function updateBackpack()
 * Outputs HTML
 * @param {string} update
 */
```

- CTRL + /: quickly comment / uncomment code

- Whitespace is just for humans. #BESTPRACTICE: Use indentation to indicate visual hierarchy

- Change Tab indent size by clicking `Spaces:2` on VSCode bottom bar

- Semicolons: JS doesn't care if semicolons or not. If anyone tells you it is wrong to do one or the other, it's not true. This is purely developer preference.

- #BESTPRACTICE: Be consistent with double quotes and single quotes
- #BESTPRACTICE: Use tools like Prettier and ESLint to automatically enforce that consistency

 #### 1.6 Learning JavaScript backward

- When you learn JS for the first time you typically start with the basics.
- But, due to the popularity of JS frameworks like React an Vue, today the first intro many people have to JS is through **advanced objects and methods**.
- For this reason, we'll start with objects / methods, then Data Types and DOM, finally functions, methods, events at end.
- Learning JS requires understing basics and patterns, but also **_Finding ways to make them make sense to you_**
- With examples first, you will see the context and then ask why questions

- Open-ended practice assigments thorughout the course
- Refer to MDN Web Docs as part of your process
- Make documentation part of your learing journey
- Documentation-based process for robust learning

 #### 1.7 Chapter Quiz

What is an indicator of someone being a good JavaScript developer?

They follow standards, invest in learning, use formatting and linting tools for consistency, and write accessible code.

<h2 class="error">BOOKMARK</h2>

### 2. Up and Running with JS  
 #### 2.0 JavaScript in an HTML document

- Where does jS live? Where do you actually write the code?
- Inline (using `style` tag)

EX: 02_01

- #BESTPRACTICE: Add script tag at end right before closing `body` tag
- Anything inside the script tag will automatically be rendered as javascript
- Can technically place script tag anywhere in the doc

Why is script tag placed at bottom?

- When browser encounters script tag all rendering stops
- But, this is an **antipattern**: we have more better modern ways of loading JS

 #### 2.1 JavaScript as an external file

- Writing inline jS is edge case: only applies to current doc and nowhere else
- #BESTPRACTICE: Put script in its own file and reference the stylesheet in whatever file you want to use it in

EX: 02_02

- index.html references script.js with the `src` attribute
- This error is noted in the course:

<aside class="error">Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'appendChild' of null at script.js:50</aside>

- #SOLVED: This is caused by the script being run in the head before the page has been rendered

 #### 2.2 Modern JavaScript loading

- Browser reads HTML top to bottom line by line and fetch and execute any elements it encounters

<blockquote class="pullquote">
When you open an HTML document in the browser, the browser will read that document line by line from the top down and fetch and execute any element it encounters as necessary.
</blockquote>

02_03

-  Typical header: references to scripts and external stylesheets
-  As browser encouters calls, stop renering, goes and gets external files, executes what external files tell it, then continues rendering
-  The error in the console is a result of the JS referenced and run in the browser before the element it is acting upon is rendered.

<blockquote>
It can't do what the JavaScript is trying to do because elements don't yet exist.
</blockquote>
 
- The traditional solution: move script tag to end of doc so browser only encounters it when it has finished rendering the whole doc. Not really a solution though, actually a #HACK / #WORKAROUND
- #GOTCHA: some JS should run at the beginning or while the doc is being loaded

- New tools in JS to tightly control when and how JS is loaded: **async** and **defer** keywords


##### Default Behavior

- Browser stops rendering when JS is encountered. JS is executed before rendering continues. Often referred to a **content blocking** or **render blocking**.

![](img/screen-course-linkedin--js-ess-2021-1.jpg)

- Blocks rendering of content of page and can cause page to load slower
- **Async**: tells browser to keep parsing HTML while JS is downloaded and only stop rendering once you have downloaded the JS

##### async

- Browser downloads JS in parallel while HTML renders. When JS is fully loaded, rendering stops while JS is executed.

![](img/screen-course-linkedin--js-ess-2021-2.jpg)

- Dramatically shortens time it takes for browser to execute everything and there is only a short render blocking issue
- **defer**:

##### defer

- Browser downloads JS in parallel while HTML renders, then  defers execution of JS until HTML rendering is complete

![](img/screen-course-linkedin--js-ess-2021-3.jpg)

- At end of script tag in index.html add the `defer` keyword

```html
<script scr="script.js" defer></script>
```

- We are deferring the execution of the script until everything esle has been rendered
- #BESTPRACTICE: async/defer should be the standard. Only use render blocking when you have a specific reason. Loading JS in the footer is now an **anti-pattern**.

<blockquote>
 async/defer should be the standard. Only use render blocking when you have a specific reason. Loading JS in the footer is now an anti-pattern.
</blockquote>

- From now on: load JS in the header then use async or defer to control when the js is loaded in the doc

 #### 2.3 JavaScript modules

- As you start working with JS you will notice files get large and hard to work with, requires scrolling up and down. #SOLUTION: JS modules
- JS modules: allow us to break pieces out of a JS file into separate files and then import back into the original file again

02_04

script.js

- at top of script.js

```javascript
import backpack from "./backpack.js"
```

- constant called `backpack` is what is being imported from backpack.js
- at bottom of backpack.js

```
export default backpack
```

- export tells browser that the entity (const) can be used by any other file it is imported into

- To get this work in HTML, tell browser the files are modules (auto deferred)
- Modules are an advanced and new feature in modern JS. But, is standard practice with React and Vue

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Module Demo</title>
    <script type="module" src="backpack.js"></script>
    <script type="module" src="script.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

#GOTCHA: Can't call backpack object in console, because it is only scoped to the file, not to the browser

- As of 2021, modules are cutting edge JS

 #### 2.4 Chapter Quiz

##### When does the browser execute JavaScript?

By default: When the script is encountered. If the script is set to "async", when the script is fully loaded. If the script is set to "defer", when the entire HTML page is rendered.

##### What is the correct markup for adding an external JavaScript file to an HTML document?

<script src="javascript.js" async></script>

While `<script src="javascript.js"></script>` is technically correct, it is recommended to always async or defer your script unless you have a specific reason for the script to cause render blocking.

##### What happens when you defer JavaScript?

The browser loads the JavaScript asynchronously when it is encountered, then waits until all HTML is rendered before executing the script.

##### JavaScript modules are heavily used in frameworks like React and Vue. What is the advantage of using modules?

Modules enable modularization of code where individual functions, components, data objects, and other parts can be separated into individual files.
