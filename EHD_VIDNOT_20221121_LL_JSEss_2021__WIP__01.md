### Description:

JavaScript is a scripting language of the web. As the web evolves from a static to a dynamic environment, technology focus is shifting from static markup and styling—frequently handled by content management systems or automated scripts—to dynamic interfaces and advanced interaction. Once seen as optional, JavaScript is now becoming an integral part of the web, infusing every layer with its script.<br><br>Through practical examples and mini-projects, this course helps you build your understanding of JavaScript piece by piece, from core principles like variables, data types, conditionals, and functions through advanced topics including loops, and DOM scripting. Along the way, instructor Morten Rand-Hendriksen provides challenges that allow you to put your new skills to the test.

## VIDEOS

### 0. Introduction  

 #### 0.0 JavaScript: The soil from which the modern web grows

- The modern web runs on JavaScript
- Foundational elements of JS
- JAMstack
- HTML is language of web content, CSS is language of web style, JS is language the binds it all together
- This course deep understanding of modern JS
- JS primary lang for everything we do on web

 #### 0.1 How to use the exercise files

- Ex files avail from GitHub
- Folder with e suffix represent the end state
- PDF attached
- Link to doc or code refs in many exercise files

### 1. JavaScript: A Brief Introduction  
 #### 1.0 JavaScript: First contact

- A new era of web dev
- JS on browser, server, localhost
  
<!-- H5 will represent slides in many cases-->
##### Apply practical skils

- Modern JS & tooling
- JSX & Typescript
- Frameworks
- We are going to start with complex and then break it down

- Typical react component is long and complex

##### JSX

- A syntax extension of JS created for the React JS framework


- If I'm going to learn React should I just learn JSX?
- NO! JSX is an extension, so you still need basics
- If you undestand the basics you will be able to quickly pickup JSX and other JS flavors

##### Components

- Objects
- Methods
- Functions
- Template Literals
- Arrays

- At end of course we will return to this component and you will be able to make sense of it

 #### 1.1 Navigating the JS landscape

- Overwhelmed by that all the JS flavors
- Vanilla Javascript
- ES2015
- Babel
- React
- Vue.js
- ECMAScript
- CoffeScript
- JSX
- TypeScript
- Angular
- ES6
- WebPack
- Node.js
- Gulp

- JS is constantly evolving

##### Morten's Incomplete Guide to Navigating the JS Landscape:

- Javascript: the core lang; sometimes referred to as vanilla JS
- This is what we will cover in this course

- ECMAScript: browser specification of the JS lang. not the lang itself, but official description of how the lang should be interpreted by browsers
- Cutting edge
  
- Babel.js: Use to convert modern JS into plain JS the browser can read

- JS is an opinionated coding lang

- TypeScript: variation, dialect, or flavor of JS introducing features like **strong typing**
- Abstracted versions of JS with additional features.
- .ts ext
- CoffeeScript: another dialect of JS


- React, Vue, Angular: JS frameworks allowing us to write JS-based font-end apps. Adds abstraction layer on top of JS
- Introduce new coding convention like JSX and reliance on tools like Beble, WebPack, and Node.js
- 

- npm, WebPack, Gulp: Build tools and infrastructure to automate the process of optimizing human-readable JavaScript for the best browser performance

- Node.js: JS server runtime used to run JS everywhere; used to run npm, WebPack, Babel, and more on your computer

TAKEAWAY:
- Learn JS first then optimize and specialize your knowledge

 #### 1.2 Tools for working with JavaScript

- Modern browser: ideally all the browsers for testing (Chrome, Firefox)
- Code editor: VS Code is becoming industry standard. Highlight code as you work
- Live server env: extension for VS Code or similar. Efficieny
- Browser console: included with every browser

- Live Server (Ritwick Dey)

 #### 1.3 Linting and formatting

- Morten is dyslexic
- Code highlighter helps, but other extensions help
- ESLint: helps auto detect coding errors and can do basic cleanup auto
- Prettier: helps auto clean up your formatting
- Both require Node.js (install Node.js via download)

##### Install NPM

- Navigate to Terminal install
- `npm install`: node package manager goes on the internet and pulls everything into VS code to get prettier and eslint to work
- With prettier you can set what rules to enforce


 #### 1.4 Get to know the browser console

- JS doesn't run in the code editor it runs in the browser

EX: 01_05

Script.js
- Click Go Live at bottom bar of VSCode
- Go to current folder 01_05
- Open console
- `window.document`

- `backpack` hit right key for autocomplete
- `backpack.toggleLid(true)`
- `backpack`: lid is still set to true

 #### 1.5 JavaScript language basics

EX: 01_06

- Write JS top to bottom
- Define functions top before you use them
- Code comments: green
- **JS Doc:** Verbose comment: `/**` [ENTER]:

```
/**
 * function updateBackpack()
 * Outputs HTML
 * @param {string} update
 */
```

- CTRL + /: quickly comment / uncomment code

- Whitespace is just for humans. #BESTPRACTICE: Use indentation to indicate visual hierarchy

- Change Tab indent size by clicking `Spaces:2` on VSCode bottom bar

- Semicolons: JS doesn't care if semicolons or not. If anyone tells you it is wrong to do one or the other, it's not true. This is purely developer preference.

- #BESTPRACTICE: Be consistent with double quotes and single quotes
- #BESTPRACTICE: Use tools like Prettier and ESLint to automatically enforce that consistency

 #### 1.6 Learning JavaScript backward

- When you learn JS for the first time you typically start with the basics.
- But, due to the popularity of JS frameworks like React an Vue, today the first intro many people have to JS is through **advanced objects and methods**.
- For this reason, we'll start with objects / methods, then Data Types and DOM, finally functions, methods, events at end.
- Learning JS requires understing basics and patterns, but also **_Finding ways to make them make sense to you_**
- With examples first, you will see the context and then ask why questions

- Open-ended practice assigments thorughout the course
- Refer to MDN Web Docs as part of your process
- Make documentation part of your learing journey
- Documentation-based process for robust learning

 #### 1.7 Chapter Quiz

What is an indicator of someone being a good JavaScript developer?

They follow standards, invest in learning, use formatting and linting tools for consistency, and write accessible code.
